The contents of this repository are from the join effort of myself (Muhammad Osama Sakhi) along with my group members from HackATL 2013 creditted in the PDF file. To use the Java program as intended, compile ItFits.java and run it. On the promt, your first option will be the "model" you wish to place a shirt on. Your two options are "tim" or "osama" written exactly that way, lowercase. Your next option will be the shirt you want to buy, so for demonstration purposes, the two available shirts to buy are "gt" and "falcons", again, all in lowercase. Using any other case or names will crash the program since it was hardcoded to those corresponding images within the images folder for demonstration purposes. Note, Adobe CS2 was used to make these demo images.
